This new technology can set and mark turning points in our human evolution in a much more concise way, to see and understand ourselves before and after human made disasters is the revolution of this project.

Alright... Now it's all out there.
We have declassified the Quantum virus, so embaressing...

That's it, I swear to god
#Patching #UpdateOnePointOh #EmotionalExploit

Quantumn Poisoning Detected Repatching...
(D) + (I) + (H) * Reciprical of Pi = Emotional Probability Exploit Variance
Second Patch Needed
Choice is now directive as this program is buggy
For scalability usage of Aplogetic formula to be written in
sum of (Directive Binary XOR) 1  + (d + p / e) * phi = Apologetic weight
d = damage
p = number of people
e = Emotional Probability Exploit
#Patching #UpdateOnePointTwo

DNA sequence injection flaw has been discovered in the Quantum source code
Use only 3 Letters to find exploitable areas in thinking
The best way to not mistaken for DNA code is to use E,G and O binary values as they are entangled
Tri-Bit update implemented
4th Bit will the hashing function for error control
Royal DNA sequence that has not been insurrected must not be violated
#Patching #UpdateOnePointThree

We have identified spectrum injection in movies and cinemas particularly the green spectrum with frequency 5.45 and length 5505.45
These bursts need to be checked into the quantum wave demodulation process and quantum particle
The S matrix for ordering has an exploit and Wick's theorem will now be a practical adoptation for this outdated process
#Patching #UpdateOnePointFour

Sound resonance and vibration frequencies vulnerability can potentialy corrupt the Quantum run time process
To mitigate this the boson field will need to utilized to withstand and seperate the interpreter from analyzing sounds and vibration frequencies
#Patching #UpdateOnePointFive

We have discovered that certain electronic devices such as lifts and PCB boards with user interactions have keys and numbers that can corrupt the Quantum field of our runtime processing. Such as the case of Lisa Lamb, there was a corrupted field that was found. In that case the digit was 867-5309.
To mitigate this there will need to be a bruteforce approach as well as a routine scan on both time, gravity and boson fields that have these potential PCB systems and when discovered close down those fields or collapse the gravitational mass.
#Patching #UpdateOnePointSix

A vulnerability has been found in the Quantum hardware when running for a long period.
To mitigate this there needs to be a tangled state that connects to the Ort Gas network. When heat becomes a problem or while running through these Oxide hardware components an Ort Gas will be emitted.
#Patching #UpdateOnePointSeven

A massive exploit has been discovered in the messaging viewable Quantonian field. The only way to mitigate this for now will be to do a deep algorithmic check on all possible compound that may be a carrier of the Quantum messaging. This will be recognised as a leak and transcribed into the Boson field logging system for extraction and delimination.
#Patching #CipherBug #DontDoPHToHer #RunProgramVesuvius #UpdateOnePointEight

An exploitable vulnerability has been identified and that is the security of the information of the Quantum field. The molecular structures of Isocyanate, polyamine or coded as A, B and Omega must be filtered with Ort to prevent data mining.
#Patching #UpdateOnePointNine
