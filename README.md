--Project Synopse--
The complete depletion of your heritage and history of being in the world deliberately caste upon each human that become victims of it. It is this policy of systematic mass murder being justified today that forms the foundation for the Genetic Archive Fund and the technology and innovation to challenge those convictions being the enterprise. From my own experiences fleeing from conflict zones is why I wish to share with those persecuted today in hope that our stories will grow and challenge any future convictions towards the policy of ethnic cleansing, extermination and genocide in the modern world. Whether it is committed en mass or spread out over time the Genetic Archive Fund will be there to help reverse this objective. Using cutting edge research and technology to give you insight on your family and loves one amidst the chaos. A society where history will remember victims not as faces and numbers but as being part of the human story that we all inherently belong to. Freely register your DNA with the Genetic Archive Fund to access the cutting edge technology available.
